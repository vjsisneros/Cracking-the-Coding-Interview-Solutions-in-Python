# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions in Python

Hello! This project contains solutions to the interview questions posed in "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle McDowell. All solutions will be implement in Python 3.6*.


## The goal of this project is two-fold:

1. Interview preparation for myself. 
2. Learning / collaboration resource for everyone else.

*Some interview questions will included multiple solutions labeled with either the algorithmic approach or data structure used.*

Please let me know if you have any suggestions, notice any bugs or incorrect solutions. 

Good luck on preparing for your technical interview!
